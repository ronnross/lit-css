# lit-css

Ok wouldn't it be cool if we could use the ES2015 template syntax as an enhancement to css? 

[Yes](#yes) | 
[No](#no)

## Yes

Great to hear. I felt the same that is why I started lit-css. I'm totally stealing ideas from [lit-html](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html)

Here our the goals of the project:

- Create something similar to sass, but using existing knowledge from JavaScript
- Make this easy for making css libs. So when you would normally reach for SASS or LESS you reach for this, and it is there, because it is already JS

To build assets just run `node index.js`


## Examples

Right now just look at index.js, but I'm working on bring some examples to the readme


## No

Just keep going the way you always have and best of luck to you!
